# hello-world
So far, for two years as an engineering student I ave been programming. It has been great to do but I feel tha it is time that I take my skills to then next level an actually become a software developer. 

Java has been the main language I programmed in so far. I want to expand my knowlege so to a level where I can actually be employable. The way to do that is by doing real worl applications and use resources that actual software developers use.

I have so far learned how to code in C# by developing a tournamnet tracking application.Although C# is a great language to learn with many useful and accessible features, my research so far seems to indicate that it is not what most companies in South Africa prefer to use so I need to also expand my knowlege into areas that are on demand.

I must say that learning C# has been a lot easier than I initially thought it would be. Besides a few differences in syntax and features, the fact that it is object oriented makes it quite similar to java, which is my first language. It is also very similar to C which I am also very familiar with so that has made the learning process rather smooth.
